# Greg Dyke & Emma Mildred are getting married!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://gadyke.github.io/images/helmets.jpeg" width="25%"/></div>

## What?
Hopefully you know who we are and have an invitation to share with us what will be a wonderful day.

## Where?
We're holding both the ceremony and the reception at the **Five Arrows Hotel (HP18 0JE)**, on the edge of the Waddesdon Manor estate near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

### If you're travelling from:
- **Cheddington, Tring or Aylesbury**: Hopefully we don't need to help you...
- **Oswestry**: ~2hr 30mins (via the M40)
- **Builth Wells**: ~3hrs (also via the M40)
- **Bristol**: ~2hrs (via the M4)
- **Murcia, Spain**: ~4hrs (via a plane)
- **Houston, Texas**: Really?

We have the hotel to ourselves, but there's also plenty of other [accommodation]({{% link _subpages/accom.md %}}) nearby if you'd like to stay the night and join us for breakfast the next day.

## When?
Saturday the 20th of January, 2018. The ceremony will take place at 1230, but Greg will happily welcome guests arriving from noon.
