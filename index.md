# Greg Dyke & Emma Mildred are getting married!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://gadyke.github.io/images/helmets.jpeg" width="50%"/></div>

## When?
**Saturday the 20th of January, 2018**. The ceremony will take place at **1pm**, but those guests joining us for that part of the day are welcome from noon.

## What?
We've both been to great weddings that have been near and far, big and small, quiet and <span style="color:red">**loud**</span>.

For our day, we've decided we want a smaller event. Although we're nowhere near done planning yet - and you'll find information here as it develops - break dancing probably won't feature.

## Where?
We're holding both the ceremony and the reception at the **Five Arrows Hotel (HP18 0JE)**, on the edge of the Waddesdon Manor estate near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

### Travel times
- **Cheddington, Tring or Aylesbury**: You know what to do...
- **Oswestry**: ~2hr 30mins (via the M40)
- **Builth Wells**: ~3hrs (also via the M40)
- **Bristol**: ~2hrs (via the M4)
- **Murcia, Spain**: ~4hrs (via a plane)
- **Houston, Texas**: Really?

### Accommodation
We have the hotel to ourselves with fifteen double rooms and one single. We're aiming to house the wedding party, those with children and our immediate families (in that order) but we'll fill up eventually! Luckily there's also plenty of accommodation nearby if you'd like to stay the night and join us for breakfast the next day, you'd be very welcome:

- The Lion, Waddesdon (~5 minute walk) - HP18 0JD
- Hartwell House, Aylesbury (~10 minute drive) - HP17 8NR
- Holiday Inn, Aylesbury (~12 minute drive) - HP22 5QT
- Premier Inn, Bicester (~15 minute drive) - OX26 1BT

## How?

### Responding to our invitation
In addition to the spiffy Limited Edition invitation you'll receive in the post, we'll be sending out digital invites that will make it easier for us to keep track of all you wonderful miscreants. Although we'd love to hear from you through whatever means, it would be useful if you could respond through that too!

### When to respond
The sooner you can confirm that you'll be able to join us the better, even though final numbers aren't vital for months yet. If you know or aren't sure you'll be able to attend, please tell us!
